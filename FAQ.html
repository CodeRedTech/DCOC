            <div class="panel-body"><p>Seating: There are no "reserved seats". Feel free to sit anywhere you wish.</p>
<p>Singing: You may join us if you wish, but do not feel obligated to sing. You will notice that we do not use musical instruments. Our singing is acapella (without an instrumental accompaniment), because the New Testament does not mention the use of instruments in the early church. We choose to follow the example of simply singing praises to the Lord. (Ephesians 5:19, Colossians 3:16)</p>
<p>Prayer: During our services, we may have several prayers. No vocal audience response is required during these prayers. The gentlemen leading us in prayer may include specific need or requests.</p>
<p>Lord's Supper: The Lord's Supper will be part of the Sunday worship. This is a celebration of Jesus' death for our sins. We observe this each Sunday without exception, as Jesus commanded us. (Acts 20:7, 1 Corinthians 11:23-29, Matthew 26:27-28)</p>
<p>Offering: As our guest, you are not expected to make a donation. We want you to feel comfortable, so if you wish, just pass the collection plate on down the row.</p>
<p>Preaching: The preacher has no title, such as Reverend, Father, or Pastor, nor will he wear vestments, because in the priesthood of believers we are all equal. He will speak for 20-30 minutes. We believe you will find the sermon refreshingly Bible centered. (Matthew 28:18-20, 1 Corinthians 2:2)</p>
<p>Invitation: After the sermon, the preacher will extend an invitation for those with a prayer request or desire to be baptized. At this time we usually stand and sing a song. Do not feel uncomfortable; you will never be singled out.
Expected of You: NOTHING AT ALL! You are welcome to participate, but do not feel obligated to do so. We do ask that you fill out a visitor's card and place it in the collection plate so that we can thank you for your visit.</p></div>

              <p>Colossians 4:5, 6 says, “Conduct yourself with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of every opportunity.  Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned, as it were, with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each person."</p>  
            
              <p>We here at the Imperial Highway Church of Christ believe that EVERY individual should hear the message of the Gospel in a loving, understanding environment.  We understand that each person comes from his or her own unique background and we welcome the opportunity to show everyone the truth of the Bible in a simple, non-confrontational way that can be easily understood.</p>

 

            <p>When you study the Bible with a member of a church of Christ, you will only be taught the Bible.  We have no church creed or universal governing body.  Each congregation tries to be the church that is described in the New Testament.</p>

 

            <p>I Thessalonians 2:3, 4 says, “For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity, or by way of deceit; but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who examines our hearts."</p>
